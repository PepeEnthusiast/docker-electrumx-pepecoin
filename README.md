# docker-electrumx-pepecoin

> Run an All-In-One Pepecoin Electrum server with docker

## Usage

```
docker build -t electrumx-pepecoin:electrumx-pepecoin .
```

```
docker run -v C:\electrumx-pepecoin:/data -p 50002:50002 electrumx-pepecoin:electrumx-pepecoin
```

If there's an SSL certificate/key (`electrumx-pepecoin.crt`/`electrumx-pepecoin.key`) in the `/data` volume it'll be used. If not, one will be generated for you.

You can view all ElectrumX environment variables here: https://github.com/spesmilo/electrumx/blob/master/docs/environment.rst

### TCP Port

By default only the SSL port is exposed. You can expose the unencrypted TCP port with `-p 50001:50001`, although this is strongly discouraged.

### WebSocket Port

You can expose the WebSocket port with `-p 50004:50004`.

### RPC Port

To access RPC from your host machine, you'll also need to expose port 8000. You probably only want this available to localhost: `-p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000`.

If you're only accessing RPC from within the container, there's no need to expose the RPC port.
